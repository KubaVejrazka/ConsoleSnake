# ConsoleSnake
## A console version of the snake game, written in Go :)
To play the game, you need to download the executable (snake_linux for Linux, snake_windows.exe for Windows) and run it.

You control the snake with arrow keys.\
Highscore is stored in a file named .highscore , if the file isn't found on game start, the program creates one.

I used a library by [eiannone](https://github.com/eiannone) to handle keyboard events, check it out here: https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard
