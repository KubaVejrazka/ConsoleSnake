# ConsoleSnake
## A console version of the snake game, written in Go :)
To play the game, you need to download the executable (snake-linux for Linux, snake-win.exe for Windows) and run it.

I used a library by [eiannone](https://github.com/eiannone) to handle keyboard events, check it out here: https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard
